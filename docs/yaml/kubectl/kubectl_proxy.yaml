synopsis: Run a proxy to the Kubernetes API server
description: "To proxy all of the kubernetes api and nothing else, use: \n\n  $ kubectl
  proxy --api-prefix=/\n  \nTo proxy only part of the kubernetes api and also some
  static files: \n\n  $ kubectl proxy --www=/my/files --www-prefix=/static/ --api-prefix=/api/\n
  \ \nThe above lets you 'curl localhost:8001/api/v1/pods'. \n\nTo proxy the entire
  kubernetes api at a different root, use: \n\n  $ kubectl proxy --api-prefix=/custom/\n
  \ \nThe above lets you 'curl localhost:8001/custom/api/v1/pods'"
options:
- name: accept-hosts
  default_value: ^localhost$,^127\.0\.0\.1$,^\[::1\]$
  usage: Regular expression for hosts that the proxy should accept.
- name: accept-paths
  default_value: ^.*
  usage: Regular expression for paths that the proxy should accept.
- name: address
  default_value: 127.0.0.1
  usage: The IP address on which to serve on.
- name: api-prefix
  default_value: /
  usage: Prefix to serve the proxied API under.
- name: disable-filter
  default_value: "false"

    If true, disable request filtering in the proxy. This is dangerous, and can leave you vulnerable to XSRF attacks, when used with an accessible port.
- name: port
  shorthand: p
  default_value: "8001"
  usage: |
    The port on which to run the proxy. Set to 0 to pick a random port.
- name: reject-methods
  default_value: POST,PUT,PATCH
  usage: |
    Regular expression for HTTP methods that the proxy should reject.
- name: reject-paths
  default_value: ^/api/.*/pods/.*/exec,^/api/.*/pods/.*/attach
  usage: Regular expression for paths that the proxy should reject.
- name: unix-socket
  shorthand: u
  usage: Unix socket on which to run the proxy.
- name: www
  shorthand: w
  usage: |
    Also serve static files from the given directory under the specified prefix.
- name: www-prefix
  shorthand: P
  default_value: /static/
  usage: |
    Prefix to serve static files under, if static file directory is specified.
inherited_options:
- name: alsologtostderr
  default_value: "false"
  usage: log to standard error as well as files
- name: api-version
  usage: |
    DEPRECATED: The API version to use when talking to the server
- name: as
  usage: Username to impersonate for the operation
- name: certificate-authority
  usage: Path to a cert. file for the certificate authority
- name: client-certificate
  usage: Path to a client certificate file for TLS
- name: client-key
  usage: Path to a client key file for TLS
- name: cluster
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig cluster to use
- name: context
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig context to use
- name: insecure-skip-tls-verify
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure
- name: kubeconfig
  usage: Path to the kubeconfig file to use for CLI requests.
- name: log-backtrace-at
  default_value: :0
  usage: when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
- name: log-dir
  usage: If non-empty, write log files in this directory
- name: logtostderr
  default_value: "false"
  usage: log to standard error instead of files
- name: match-server-version
  default_value: "false"
  usage: Require server version to match client version
- name: namespace
  shorthand: "n"
  usage: If present, the namespace scope for this CLI request
- name: password
  usage: Password for basic authentication to the API server
- name: request-timeout
  default_value: "0"
  usage: |
    The length of time to wait before giving up on a single server request. Non-zero values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h). A value of zero means don't timeout requests.
- name: server
  shorthand: s
  usage: The address and port of the Kubernetes API server
- name: stderrthreshold
  default_value: "2"
  usage: logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
- name: token
  usage: Bearer token for authentication to the API server
- name: user
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig user to use
- name: username
  usage: Username for basic authentication to the API server
- name: v
  shorthand: v
  default_value: "0"
  usage: log level for V logs
- name: vmodule
  usage: |
    comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging
example: "  # Run a proxy to kubernetes apiserver on port 8011, serving static content
  from ./local/www/\n  kubectl proxy --port=8011 --www=./local/www/\n  \n  # Run a
  proxy to kubernetes apiserver on an arbitrary local port.\n  # The chosen port for
  the server will be output to stdout.\n  kubectl proxy --port=0\n  \n  # Run a proxy
  to kubernetes apiserver, changing the api prefix to k8s-api\n  # This makes e.g.
  the pods api available at localhost:8001/k8s-api/v1/pods/\n  kubectl proxy --api-prefix=/k8s-api"
