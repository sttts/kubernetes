  Output shell completion code for the specified shell (bash or zsh)
description: "Output shell completion code for the specified shell (bash or zsh).
  The shell code must be evalutated to provide interactive completion of kubectl commands.
  \ This can be done by sourcing it from the .bash _profile. \n\nNote: this requires
  the bash-completion framework, which is not installed by default on Mac.  This can
  be installed by using homebrew: \n\n  $ brew install bash-completion\n  \nOnce installed,
  bash completion must be evaluated.  This can be done by adding the following line
  to the .bash profile \n\n  $ source $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion\n  \nNote
  for zsh users: [1] zsh completions are only supported in versions of zsh >= 5.2"
